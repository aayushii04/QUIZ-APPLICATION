PROJECT NAME-INTERACTIVE QUIZ APPLICATION
DESCRIPTION:
This project is a simple, yet fully functional, **interactive multiple-choice quiz application** built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
The primary goal of this project is to provide hands-on practice with fundamental web development concepts:

* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updating the page content (questions, options, score).
* **Event Handling:** Responding to user clicks on the answer options and the "Next" or "Submit" button.
* **Data Handling:** Storing and managing the quiz questions, options, and correct answers using **JavaScript arrays and objects**.
* **Control Flow:** Utilizing **conditional statements** (like `if`/`else`) to check answers and update the score.
* ## üöÄ How to Run the Project

Since all the necessary code (HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic) is contained within a single file, setting up and running the quiz is extremely straightforward.

1.  **Save the File:** Ensure all your code is saved in a single file named `index.html` (or any other name ending in `.html`).
2.  **Open in Browser:** Locate the saved `index.html` file on your computer.
3.  **Double-Click:** Double-click the file to open it automatically in your default web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
4.  ## ‚ú® Features

### Core Features

* **Multiple-Choice Interface:** Presents one question at a time with four selectable answer options.
* **Answer Highlighting:** Provides immediate visual feedback by styling the selected answer upon submission (or moving to the next question).
* **Progress Tracking:** Moves sequentially through all questions.
* **Final Score Display:** Calculates and shows the user's total correct score at the end of the quiz.
* **Restart Option:** (If implemented) Allows the user to reset the quiz and play again.
* ## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content.
* **CSS3:** For styling and making the quiz visually appealing.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For the application logic, data management, and interactivity.
